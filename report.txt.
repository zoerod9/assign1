1. I completed this assignment by myself with the help of a private tutor.
2, 3. I think that everything is correct, maybe with the exception of some memory faults.
But I belive that I tested the program enough to work correctly on any file being
fed through input.
4. Working with threads was insteresting, I think the next assignment will be even more
interesting with passing different variables through threads.
